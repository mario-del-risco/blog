I am confronted with a picture not seen long ago portrayed, almost a miracle of coincidence. 
There are out-there lifeforms that knew what *I* felt. They knew without touch, without fear.

I found a wrecked man on more than one occasion. He wanted to stay with me but I was bound to the ocean. 
I cried a cry of help in his name, but he only gave me fish. "What can I possibly do with this stinky fish?" I thoughtâ€”small, but wise, is our predisposition.

He said that the fish would live forever, ever feeding, as long as I would be willing to listen to other lifeforms outside of my little chunk.
*"But I am so flawed! I can only live what is for me to be lived!"* 

As I said this his eyes went away. He took his hat off and extended a prism to me. He said:
***"Look in the direction that cannot be seen and wait for the feeling of assurance."***
We never saw each other again, the fish no longer. 
I think I lost my tracks when turning behind a sun dune or in one of the many times I failed to listen.
